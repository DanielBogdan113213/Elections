   ```bash
   You can start the app and test the ping

3. **Run docker:**

4. **Stop docker:**

   ```bash
   "docker stop app"
   
5. **Run docker-compose:**

   ```bash
   Comment the H2 settings in application.properties
   In git bash in the folder: "mvn clean package"
   To create image and run container: "docker-compose up --build"

6. **Stop docker-compose:**

   ```bash
   "docker-compose down -v"

7. **Delete Images, Containers & Networks:**

   ```bash
   "docker system prune -a"
   
8. **Open in swagger:**
   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
    ```bash
   if you open the swagger, you can test if works with the ping controller
